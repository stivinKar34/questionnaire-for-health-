                Dear participant, Thank you for agreeing to fill in this questionnaire. The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the contribution of simulation-based learning on knowledge acquisition and competency in skills among undergraduate nursing students. Any information collected from you during this study will be kept strictly confidential. Your data will be assigned a unique identifier, and your personal information will be separated from research data to ensure anonymity. Please answer the following questions to the best of your knowledge (Please tick only one correct answer). Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary, and you can withdraw at any time without penalty. If you have any questions or need further clarification, do not hesitate to ask.
            </p>
